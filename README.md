Here’s a sample `README.md` for a user guide on how to use a Helm template stored in JFrog Artifactory, along with details on configuration, deployment, and usage.

# Helm Chart User Guide

## Overview

This repository contains Helm charts designed to deploy applications in Kubernetes environments. The charts are stored in JFrog Artifactory and can be fetched and deployed based on user-specific configurations.

## Prerequisites

- **Helm 3.x** installed.
- Access to the **JFrog Artifactory** Helm repository.
- Kubernetes cluster access configured (via `kubectl`).

## Getting Started

### 1. Add the JFrog Artifactory Helm Repository

Before deploying the Helm chart, you need to add the JFrog Artifactory Helm repository to your Helm client.

```bash
helm repo add my-artifactory-helm https://<jfrog-instance-url>/artifactory/helm-repo --username <jfrog-username> --password <jfrog-password>
helm repo update
```

- Replace `<jfrog-instance-url>` with the URL of your JFrog Artifactory instance.
- Replace `<jfrog-username>` and `<jfrog-password>` with your JFrog credentials.

### 2. Fetch the Helm Chart

To fetch the Helm chart from the JFrog repository, use the following command:

```bash
helm search repo my-artifactory-helm/<chart-name>
```

- Replace `<chart-name>` with the name of the Helm chart you want to deploy.

### 3. Deploying the Helm Chart

You can install or upgrade the Helm chart in your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

```bash
helm upgrade --install <release-name> my-artifactory-helm/<chart-name> --version <chart-version> -f values.yaml
```

- `<release-name>`: The name you want to assign to the release.
- `<chart-name>`: The name of the Helm chart (e.g., `my-app-chart`).
- `<chart-version>`: The version of the chart you want to deploy.
- `-f values.yaml`: A custom values file that contains your deployment-specific configurations.

### 4. Customizing the Deployment

To customize your deployment, you can create or modify the `values.yaml` file. This file allows you to override default values and define the behavior of the Helm chart.

Example `values.yaml`:

```yaml
app:
  nameOverride: "my-custom-app"

deployment:
  enabled: true
  containers:
    - name: my-app-container
      image: my-app-image:1.0.0
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      env:
        - name: ENV_VAR
          value: "production"

service:
  enabled: true
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080

ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - host: "example.com"
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix

hpa:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 75
```

In this example:
- **Deployment**: Configures the application containers, environment variables, and ports.
- **Service**: Exposes the application via a ClusterIP service.
- **Ingress**: Configures ingress rules for external access.
- **HPA**: Enables the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).

### 5. Updating the Helm Chart

If you need to update the Helm chart version or configuration, simply use the following command to upgrade the release:

```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> my-artifactory-helm/<chart-name> --version <new-chart-version> -f values.yaml
```

### 6. Uninstalling the Helm Chart

To uninstall the Helm release and remove all associated Kubernetes resources, use:

```bash
helm uninstall <release-name>
```

### 7. Helm Chart Structure

The Helm chart follows a typical structure:
```
my-helm-chart/
  ├── Chart.yaml            # Chart metadata (name, version, description)
  ├── values.yaml           # Default configuration values
  ├── templates/            # Kubernetes resource templates (Deployment, Service, etc.)
  └── helpers.tpl           # Helper functions for templating
```

### 8. Working with JFrog Artifactory

To push a new version of the chart to JFrog Artifactory, use the following commands:

1. Package the Helm chart:
   ```bash
   helm package <chart-directory>
   ```

2. Push the chart to the JFrog repository using JFrog CLI:
   ```bash
   jfrog rt helm-push <chart.tgz> <repo-name>
   ```

3. Verify that the chart has been successfully uploaded:
   ```bash
   helm search repo my-artifactory-helm/<chart-name>
   ```

## Common Commands

### View Installed Releases

```bash
helm list
```

### Rollback to Previous Version

```bash
helm rollback <release-name> <revision-number>
```

### Inspect a Chart Before Installation

```bash
helm show values my-artifactory-helm/<chart-name> --version <chart-version>
```

### Debugging Helm Installations

For troubleshooting, you can use the `--debug` flag:

```bash
helm upgrade --install <release-name> my-artifactory-helm/<chart-name> --version <chart-version> --debug
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Helm repository not found**: Ensure you have added the correct JFrog Artifactory URL and that your credentials are valid.
- **Chart version not found**: Check if the specified version exists in the repository by running `helm search repo my-artifactory-helm/<chart-name>`.
- **Missing values**: Ensure that all required values in the `values.yaml` are properly defined. Refer to the chart’s `values.yaml` file for defaults.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the Helm chart, please submit a pull request or open an issue for any bugs or feature requests.
